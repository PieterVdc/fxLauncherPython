# fxLauncherPython

to run code directly install python, (originally made in 3.10 but newer versions in the 3.x shouldn't break anything)

before running required library will need to be installed with the command 'python -m pip install PySimpleGUI' in your command prompt,
or 'python3 -m pip install PySimpleGUI' on mac/linux

when translation added MO file will need to be rebuild,

//TODO add build exe instruction
